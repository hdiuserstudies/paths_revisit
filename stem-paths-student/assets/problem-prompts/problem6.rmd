### Please think-aloud as you solve the following math problem

Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins. Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?
