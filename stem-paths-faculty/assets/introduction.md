# Introduction

This is a survey to evaluate the difficulty of probability and combinatorics math problems.  
The survey contains 30 math problems and a short demographic questionnaire.

It will take approximately 60 minutes to finish this survey. 

For each question, we ask you to think-aloud as you solve each problem and then, you will select the correct multiple choice answer.
You will then be asked to indicate how many minutes you would allocate for a student to solve the same problem.
