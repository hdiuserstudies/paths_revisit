        <p>You will now have <b>2 minutes</b> to solve the problem. Please play the video above when you are ready. Once the timer ends, <b>Time's Up</b> will be displayed for you to move on to the next part of the study. 
        </br> </br>

            <b>Let Xₖ be the time elapsed between the (k-1)th accident and the k-th accident. Suppose X₁, X₂, ... are independent of each other. You use the exponential distribution with the probability density function: f(t) = 0.4e^(-0.4t), for t > 0, measured in minutes to model Xₖ. What is the probability of at least two accidents happening in a five-minute period?</b>
