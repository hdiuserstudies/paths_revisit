### Please think-aloud as you solve the following math problem

A bag contains 10 marbles, each labeled with a distinct integer from 1 to 10. Two marbles are randomly drawn from the bag without replacement. Let p be the probability that the product of the numbers on the two marbles is even. Let f(x) = x² - 3x + 2 and g(x) = √(x + 1). Compute g(f(p)), expressing your answer as a common fraction.
