### Please think-aloud as you solve the following math problem

A math teacher prepares a test with a total of 15 questions: 5 multiple-choice questions (each with 4 options to choose from and only one correct answer), 5 true or false questions, and 5 numerical-answer questions. After grading the tests, she observes that on average, each type of question was answered correctly by 60% of the students. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability rounded to the nearest whole number that the student correctly answered at least one of each type of question?
