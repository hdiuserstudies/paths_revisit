# Introduction

This is a pilot survey to evaluate the difficulty of probability and combination math problems.  
The survey contains 3 math problems and a short demographic questionnaire.

It will take approximately 15 minutes to finish this survey. 

For each problem, read the question and set a timer in minutes based on your estimated solving time before beginning.
Once time is up, you will select the correct multiple choice answer.
Lastly, you will then be asked to indicate how many minutes you would allocate for a student to solve the same problem.
